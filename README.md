Regression discontinuity bootstrap bias correction (potential) paper
====================================================================

At the moment, this repository has been set up for a potential research paper
that looks at using the bootstrap to correct the bias of regression
discontinuity estimators. We are planning to run monte carlo simulations first
to verify that the bootstrap works, then hammer out the theory if and only if
it performs well.
