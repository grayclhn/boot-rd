Hi Matias,

\strut

Regarding referee 1's comments,
\begin{itemize}

Regarding referee 2's comments.
\begin{itemize}
\item (placeholder)
\end{itemize}
We have also made the small notational changes and new definitions
the referees requested.

In addition, we discovered a small error in the simulation results ---
instead of reporting each estimator's bias, we reported the negative
bias. Since the values were close to zero, this does not have a
substantive effect on the results but we have, of course, fixed the
tables.

Best,
